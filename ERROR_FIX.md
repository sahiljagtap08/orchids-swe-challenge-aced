If you are encountering a persistent `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'playwright'` when running your FastAPI backend, even though you have installed the `playwright` package and see it in your `.venv` site-packages.

**Whatâ€™s happening?**
- You installed `playwright` and its dependencies in your virtual environment.
- However, when running `uvicorn`, the Python interpreter being used does not see the `playwright` package.

**Why does this happen?**
- This is almost always due to a mismatch between the Python environment where you installed the package and the environment from which you are running your app.
- Sometimes, the terminal session is not using the correct virtual environment, or `uvicorn` is being run with the system Python instead of the virtual environment Python.

---

## How to Fix

### 1. Ensure the Virtual Environment is Activated

Before running `uvicorn`, make sure your virtual environment is activated:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(.venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt.

---

### 2. Check Python Executable

Check which Python is being used:

```bash
which python
```

It should point to something like `/Users/sahiljagtap/Downloads/orchids-swe-challenge-completed-main/backend/.venv/bin/python`.

---

### 3. Run Uvicorn Using the Virtual Environment Python

Instead of just running `uvicorn ...`, run it as:

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

This ensures the `uvicorn` process uses the Python interpreter from your virtual environment, which has `playwright` installed.

---

### 4. Double-Check Playwright Installation

While your logs show `playwright` is installed, you can also try:

```bash
pip show playwright
```

This should show details about the package. If it says "not found," you are not in the right environment.

---

### 5. (Optional) Reinstall Playwright in the Virtual Environment

If the above does not work, try:

```bash
pip uninstall playwright
pip install playwright
```

---

## Summary

- Always activate your virtual environment before running your app.
- Use `python -m uvicorn ...` to ensure the correct Python interpreter is used.
- Double-check your environment with `which python` and `pip show playwright`.

---

**Try these steps and your `ModuleNotFoundError` should be resolved. If you still see the error, let me know the output of `which python` and `pip show playwright` after activating your virtual environment.**
